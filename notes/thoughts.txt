so it takes fucking forever to read 1 chat at a time

1 driver controls 1 browser

even if i had multiple tabs open in 1 browser, it would need a locking system to properly manage
and even then it would still only focus on 1 browser at a time

so i need to open multiple browsers
and have each browser remember its behavior to do/close

it would be much nicer if i could open tabs on the same driver and have a new driver control that tab
cause that would likely allow for preserving the login state
or just create a browser using the same cookies / session



i should have 1 driver control 1 browser

i should have a max number of browsers that can be opened
i can then create a threadpool for queuing drivers for actions such as messaging multiple users

i should have tabs be opened when i'm opening a new page
otherwise i can just focus on the already opened page
i should close tabs after a set amount of time



since Driver is setup to globally use 1 browser, i'll need to update it to having a browser
per Driver object











since i'm going to be saving pages and opening new tabs,
some functions are going to need to be updated to searching for already existing browsers
and then if one of those browsers has the page already open
if not, then it should open a tab from the main browser for example to the users page


user.discount
user.get_id
user.message
user.enter_message
user.message stuff
user.read_chat
user.read_statements
user.get_active_users
user.get_following
